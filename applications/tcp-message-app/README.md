   * In option 3, when client request messages from the server, server is only sending back the last message sent. You need to send all the messages that were sent to that client 
   
   * Option 4 not correctly implemented and therefore option 5 cannot be graded. I get the following error when trying to select option 4: 
   
   ```
   Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "client.py", line 85, in <module>
    client.run()
  File "client.py", line 76, in run
    self.user_name)
TypeError: createnewchannel() takes 5 positional arguments but 6 were given
   ```
   * Thomas, I know you worked hard in this assignment but since I cannot grade options 4 and 5, I cannot give you more points. Normally, in this situation your grade would be 75 points, but I know you deserved more points because of all the effort put in the assignment, that is why I gave you 10 more points.
